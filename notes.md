A comment in the HTML section can run across one or more lines.
Itâ€™s located between the character strings <!-- and -->.
In the JavaScript section, a comment that spans one or more lines
is noted between the /_ and _/ strings.
If you want to write a short comment in the JavaScript section (for
example, after a statement), the // string is suitable. Such a
comment is only one line in length.
